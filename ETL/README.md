This repository contains two distinct ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes designed to facilitate data movement and transformation. The two ETL processes included in this repository are:

### 1. SQL To SQL
The ETL process involves extracting data from a transactional SQL database and loading it into another SQL database for storage

### 2. No-SQL To SQL
The ETL process involves extracting data from a MongoDB database and loading it into another SQL database for storage
